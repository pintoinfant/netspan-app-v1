### **Discovering Order in the World of Cellular Networks**

The realm of cellular networks is vast and complex, with countless providers serving communities worldwide. Each provider is distinguished by a unique identifier known as a PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) code. Until now, there has been no unified system or governing body to allocate and coordinate these identifiers.

That's where we come in. Welcome to the Netspan Token Curated Registry (TCR) on the Althea Network, where we aim to revolutionize the world of cellular communications.

### **Our Mission**

Our mission is simple yet revolutionary: to establish a standardized, decentralized, and community-driven system for the allocation of PLMN identifiers. Through blockchain technology and smart contracts written in Solidity, we're forging a new path toward a coordinated future for cellular networks.

### **How Does It Work?**

**Smart Contracts**: Our Solidity contract enables organizations to submit PLMN requests. These requests are then subjected to a rigorous approval process by staked voters within our community.

**Transparent Governance**: We believe in transparency and community-driven decision-making. Our platform includes essential tools for adding or removing voters, becoming a part of the voting set, and approving PLMN requests.

**Decentralized Coordination**: By leveraging the power of the Althea Network and blockchain technology, we're shifting control from centralized authorities to the community, ensuring that PLMN identifiers are assigned fairly and efficiently.

### **Why Choose the Netspan TCR on Althea?**
