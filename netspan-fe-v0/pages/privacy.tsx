                NFTCONOMY operates with many of our systems based in the United
                States. As a result, we may transfer personal data from Europe
                to third countries outside of Europe, including the United
                States, under the following conditions:
              </SmallHeading>
              <li>
                Contractual Obligation. Where transfers are necessary to satisfy
                our obligation to you under our Terms, including to provide you
                with our Services and customer support services, and to optimize
                and enhance NFTCONOMY; and

                Consent: where you have consented to the transfer of your
                personal data to a third country.
              </li>
              <SmallHeading>
                Where transfers to a third country are based on your consent,
                you may withdraw your consent at any time. Please understand,
                however, that our services may not be available if we are unable
                to transfer personal data to third countries. When we transfer
                personal data to third countries, we endeavor to ensure adequate
                safeguards are implemented, for example through the use of
                standard contractual clauses or Privacy Shield certification.
