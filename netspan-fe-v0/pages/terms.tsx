              usernames, passwords, public and/or private keys, or any other
              codes that User uses to access the Service. If you are given or
              create a password to access the Platform, you are responsible for
              maintaining the confidentiality of your account and your password.
              If you use a Wallet to access the Platform, NFTconomy has no way
              of granting you access to the site if you lose access to, or
              control of, your Wallet. You are responsible for all activities
              that occur under your account, and you agree to notify the Company
              immediately of any suspected unauthorized use of your account. The
              Company is not responsible for any loss that you may incur as a
              result of any unauthorized person using your account, Wallet. or
              your password. Any unauthorized access to your account by third
              parties could result in the loss or theft of funds held in your
              account and any associated accounts, including your linked bank
              account(s) and credit card(s).
            </Paragraph>
            <SmallHeading>4.2.4 Additional Considerations.</SmallHeading>
            <SmallHeading>
              4.2.4.1 Transactions Are Recorded on the Public Blockchains.
            </SmallHeading>
            <Paragraph>
              Transactions that take place on the Platform are managed and
              confirmed via public blockchains including but not limited to the
              Ethereum blockchain. The User understands that its public address
              on the relevant blockchain will be made publicly visible whenever
              it engages in a transaction on the Platform. We neither own nor
              control MetaMask, or any other Wallet, the Ethereum network, or
              any other blockchain network We choose to interface with, or any
              other third-party site, product, or service that Users might
              access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling the user to
              access and utilize the various features of the Platform. We will
              not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties,
              nor will we be liable for any damage that a User may suffer as a
              result of its transactions or any other interaction with any such
              third parties.
            </Paragraph>
            <SmallHeading>4.2.4.2 Gas.</SmallHeading>
            <Paragraph>
              All transactions on the Platform are facilitated by smart
              contracts existing on a blockchain network. Blockchain networks
              generally require the payment of a transaction fee for every
              transaction. For example, the Ethereum network requires the
              payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas fee”) for every transaction
              that occurs on the Ethereum network, and thus every transaction
              occurring on the Platform through the Ethereum network. The value
              of the Gas Fee changes, often unpredictably, and is entirely
              outside of the control of Company or the Platform. User
              acknowledges that under no circumstances will a transaction on the
              Platform, including payment of the Premium Fee be invalidated,
              revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis
              that the Gas Fee for the given transaction was unknown, too high,
              or otherwise unacceptable to User.
            </Paragraph>
            <SmallHeading>4.2.4.3 Our Use of Account Information.</SmallHeading>
            <Paragraph>
              Premium Users authorize us to use the account information for all
              purposes related to the Service, provided that such access shall
              be used solely for the purpose of providing the Service.
            </Paragraph>
            <SmallHeading>4.3 License.</SmallHeading>
            <Paragraph>
              Subject to this Agreement, NFTconomy grants you a
              non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to use
              and access the Service solely for your own use, and solely as
              permitted by and in compliance with the Terms and Applicable Law.
              Such limited license may be revoked at any time in NFTconomy's
              sole discretion.

            <Paragraph>
              The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile.
              Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially
              and adversely affect the value of NFTs, which may also be subject
              to significant price volatility. A lack of use or public interest
              in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could
              negatively impact the development, potential utility, or value of
              NFTs. The Platform, ETH, NFTs, and other digital assets could be
              impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory action.
              For all of the foregoing reasons, as well as for reasons that may
              not presently be known to the Company, the Company makes
              absolutely no representations or warranties of any kind regarding
              the value of NFTs or other digital assets.

              terms or in reference to or at once or not directly regarding
              those Terms or any of the topics or transactions pondered with the
              aid of using those Terms (for the avoidance of doubt, along with
              any declare searching for to invalidate, or alleging that, any or
              all a part of those Terms is unenforceable, void or voidable)
              (such claims, disputes and controversies, collectively,
              "Disputes") and not resolved after 60 days of negotiations since
              the rise of such dispute, will be eventually settled with the aid
              of using binding arbitration. The arbitrator shall have
              distinctive authority to clear up all Disputes, and the arbitral
              award will be very last and binding upon the parties. The
              Arbitration shall take place in English. The seat of Arbitration
              shall be Singapore. The venue of the arbitral proceedings can be
              online or determined as per convenience of the parties. All Users
              hereby agree that any arbitration or claim shall be undertaken in
              their individual capacity and not as a joint class action.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              NFTconomy Technologies or any User may also provoke an arbitration
              intending through turning in written notice to the other,
              whereupon the parties shall fairly cooperate to pick out an
              arbitrator and submit the Dispute to such arbitrator. In the event
              the parties are not able to agree on the choice of an arbitrator
              within 15 days from the submitting of a call for arbitration, the
              Council for National and International Commercial Arbitration
              ('CNICA'), Chennai and will be decided by a sole arbitrator
              appointed by CNICA; The arbitrator's award will be written and

            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              The parties agree that the arbitral process shall be conducted in
              confidentiality and disclosure of any information about the
              arbitrator proceedings or information learned during the
              proceedings could be detrimental to the business of the other
              party. The receiving party shall be liable to further damages if
              there is any breach of such Confidentiality and unauthorized
              disclosure of confidential information.
